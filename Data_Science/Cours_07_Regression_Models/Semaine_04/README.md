# Content of this folder
This folder is dedicated to the Course ***Regression models***, which is the ${7^{th}}$ course of the Data Science Specialization MOOC.

This folder contains the exercices and projects about the week 4, which concerns ***Logistic Regression*** and ***Poisson Regression***.

Three kinds of files are posted in  this folder :

 * ***Swirl files***
    These files are the results of the training exercices provided by the *swirl* library :
    1. <span style="color:blue">***10_swirl_Variation_Inflation_Factors.pdf***</span> : study of the facts that can explain variance inflation
    2. <span style="color:blue">***11_swirl_Overfitting_and_Underfitting.pdf***</span> : study of the impact of adding or removing predictors on a multilinear model
    3. <span style="color:blue">***12_swirl_Binary_Outcomes.pdf***</span> : study of the prediction of binary outcomes (e.g. wins/losses) using logistic regression
    4. <span style="color:blue">***13_swirl_Count_Outcomes.pdf***</span> : study of the prediction of count outcomes (e.g. nb of visits on a Web site) using Poisson regression
    
  * ***Quiz files***
 The files are my personal version of the quiz for week 4. This quiz is rendered under the followinf formats :
 1. ***.md format*** : this format is markdown format
 2. ***.pdf format*** : this file is created from .Rmd file using TexMex package, which provides ${\LaTeX}$ outlook.
 
   * ***Final project***
 
 The final project is a validation project which asks to study a concrete case and analyze it. The student is free to use the analyze tools and methods he/she wants, under the condition that the project instructions are followed. These instructions are defined in the file called <span style="color:blue">***Regression Model Course Project.docx***</span>. 
 
 As for the quiz files, the output formats are .md and .pdf. 
 
 * ***pictures***

All the figures used by the .md files are stored in the folder ***figure***.
